# SHACL Resources

This repository contains Shapes Constraints Language (SHACL) resources to exemplify it and support its use.

Initial resources in here were created by the re-established [W3C Data Shapes Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/data-shapes/) in 2025. It is expected that this will be a living repository that will persist after the closing of that Working Group and will be maintained by a community group.
